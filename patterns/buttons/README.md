The buttons use our primary color to draw attention and stand out. Each button has a specific purpose:

 The light buttons are for secondary background areas.(Only use when needed too.)
 The Yellow buttons should be the most important buttons on the page.To create emphasis on the page.
 The Yellow buttons with no border are to be used when the background is dark and doesn't need the border to show its shape.
 The Small buttons are only if necessary.If you need to style a card or smaller things that only need a small button.

Feel free to mix them with the `font-size` classes to make different sizes of buttons.
