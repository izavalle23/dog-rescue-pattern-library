The buttons use our primary color to draw attention and stand out. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where the background is a light color
- The light buttons are for dark background areas
- The ghost buttons should be used exclusively on banner where the background is an image
- The Yellow buttons should be the most important buttons on the page.
- The Yellow buttons with no border are to be used when the background is dark and doesn't need the border to show its shape.

Feel free to mix them with the `font-size` classes to make different sizes of buttons.
